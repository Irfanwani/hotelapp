    <p>Welcome to {{hotelName}}</p>

    <!-- Angular makes writing js easier.
in angular, Document.querySelector('div').innerText = hotelName; can be written as below, where we provide the property in the brackets which is to be changed and then provide the value in the quotes which also is a variable from ts file of the component -->

    <div [ngStyle]="rooms.availableRooms ? {'color': 'green'} : {'color': 'red'}" [innerText]='hotelName'></div>
</div>

{{rooms.availableRooms ?? "no rooms"}}

<div *ngIf="rooms?.availableRooms">
    Rooms List
<app-rooms-list [rooms]="roomList"></app-rooms-list>
</div>
